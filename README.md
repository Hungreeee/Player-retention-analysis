# Player-retention-analysis
The project is a test to find out hidden issues in bad player retention of a hypothetical mobile game. Given the data provided, the possible source of problems for lower
game performance to analyze can be a lack of player acquisition, low player retention, or other in-game issues.

- Player acquisition: Analyze and find out if there is any issue with the player acquisition process from different marketing sources. This may reflect the performance of the marketing campaign from different sources to understand how efficient are the game marketing drawing the attention of first-time players.
- Player retention: Gain insights on player activity and how effective Merge Vikings is retaining their users. By investigating this aspect, we can identify the potential issue if the retention falls dramatically at some stage.
- Playerâ€™s game perspective: Analyze to understand the gaming experiences of user. If retention is falling, if marketing is doing well, the cause is likely to come from the game itself. By investigating the game design, we are able to understand which part of the gameplay caused the overall performance of the game itself to decrease.
